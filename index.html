          <p>Bishop Ishmael Sam is a Christian leader, megachurch pastor, preacher, author, international conference speaker and
          resident bishop of the Truth Cathedral, Loyalty House International. He is a theologian, as well, with a Master of
          Theology in Pentecostalism and Media from the Trinity Theological Seminary. The Loyalty House International is a
          denomination of the United Denominations Originating From The Lighthouse Group Of Churches (UD-OLGC) founded by Bishop
          Dag Heward-Mills.</p>
          <p>He attended Sekondi College from 1978 to 1985 for both his O-levels and A-levels. He worked at the Bank of Ghana from
            1989 until early 1993 when he entered full time ministry. After obtaining his masters degree in Theology at Trinity Theological Seminary, he continued to the Ghana Institute of
            Management and Public Administration (GIMPA) pursuing his PhD.</p>
          <p>He joined the newly founded Lighthouse Chapel in the 1980s where Bishop Dag appointed him as the first follow-up
          director of the church. He was appointed a pastor in June 1991 and subsequently became a full-time pastor in March 1993.
          He was later transferred to Tema to start a branch of the church. Starting at the premises of a local bar called
          El-Paso, he would lead this church to become a megachurch within the Tema District. The church built a cathedral in Tema
          Community 8 called the Cornerstone Cathedral.</p>
          <p>
          In 2017, Bishop Sam was transferred to Dawhenya from Tema. In 2021, the Truth Cathedral built in Dawhenya was dedicated
          by Bishop Dag Heward-Mills</p>
          <p>He lectures regularly at the Anagkazo Bible and Ministry Training Centre. He also travels preaching and teaching in
          Ghana and across the world. From 2012 till 2019, he held an annual eastern European tour preaching and teaching in Ukraine and Russia. This continued virtually via video recorded teachings, zoom sessions and online sessions due to the Covid-19 pandemic
          and the subsequent war in Ukraine which begun in 2022.</p>
          <p>He holds the annual Transform Your Ministry Conference in Dawhenya, where ministers are ordained and equipped to serve
          in the ministry.</p>
          <p>He is married to Olivia Adalena Sam and together they have 3 children, all of whom are actively involved in the ministry.
          In 2021, he authored his first book, Retention and Church Growth. Bishop Dag Heward-Mills wrote the foreword to
          the book and described it as " a tool for every church worker who desires to build a thriving, growing and flourishing
          church."</p>
